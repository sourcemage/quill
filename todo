things that would be cool to have:
new menu choices
  * 'Manage patches'
	add/remove them and their references in PRE_BUILD
	add/remove PRE_BUILD

  * 'Add another version'
	branches
	SCM: wierd versions; also needs the autoupdate stuff; only for -w

  * 'list/remove files?'

  * 'Manage CONFIGURE options'

update mode:
  * plug other linters at the end of the update and move them all in liblint
  * add mirror support for SOURCE_URLs when adding new sources

improvements in the standard mode:
  * handle bad entries and ^C better

fmxml:
  * dump xml-grep (awk, sed)?
  * redo html parsing

documentation:
  * write a manpage

modules:
  * a try-all switch with some basic apriori module reckognition support

overall:
  * Improve scripting support to make it possible to write alternate interfaces for it
  * add quill mode to /quillrc to avoid the need to constantly pass it
  * wrapping for too long history additions

  <p3pilot> i am a believer in using quill for updates...very few failures and is just quicker for me
