post 0.2 things that would be cool to have done:
new menu choices
  * 'Manage patches'
	add/remove them and their references in PRE_BUILD
	add/remove PRE_BUILD

  * 'Add another version'
	branches
	SCM: wierd versions; also needs the autoupdate stuff; only for -w

  * 'Convert to upstream signing'
	try automatically on updates (check for .sig. .asc)?
	downloadable or manually included

  * 'list/remove files?'

  * 'Manage CONFIGURE options'

update mode:
  * clean the namespace by moving more stuff into functions
  * plug other linters at the end of the update and move them all in liblint

improvements in the standard mode:
  * use some of the functions from update mode,
	especially the verification stuff
  * handle bad entries and ^C better

fmxml:
  * improve the speed
  * dump xml-grep (awk, sed)?
  * redo html parsing

documentation:
  * write a manpage

overall:
  * Improve scripting support to make it possible to write alternate interfaces for it
