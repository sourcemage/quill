post 0.2 things that would be cool to have done:
new menu choices
  * 'Manage patches'
	add/remove them and their references in PRE_BUILD
	add/remove PRE_BUILD

  * 'Add another version'
	branches
	SCM: wierd versions; also needs the autoupdate stuff

  * 'Convert to upstream signing'
	try automatically on updates (check for .sig)?

  * 'list/remove files?'

update mode:
  * create a main_update_loop and use it in the patching case too
  * clean the namespace by moving more stuff into functions, using locals and
	documenting global vars used in all functions

improvements in the standard mode:
  * use some of the functions from update mode,
	especially the verification stuff
  * handle bad entries and ^C better
  * use summon and more of the sorcery code?
  * don't use summon. as it should be able to be run without root privs.

fmxml:
  * sanitize, dump curl?
    I belive there is a problem with the xml if not running curl
  * improve the speed, dump xml-grep?
    Erm planning to implement own XML parser?

documentation:
  * write a manpage

overall:
  * Improve scripting support to make it possible to write alternate interfaces for it
